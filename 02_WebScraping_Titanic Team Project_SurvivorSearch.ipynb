As the minutes rolled by Lightoller;s survival instincts got sharper. He held on to his dear life by clutching onto an inverted boat until rescue came by.

So, their dad bought the Titanic ticket and planned to relocate with his children to the USA. He even faked names for himself and his children in order to secure tickets. When the Titanic disaster struck and death was about to lay its icy hand on him and the children, Michel Sr. secured the last lifeboat for his children.

Seated in the first-class compartment as a couple, they rushed for the first lifeboat. Lucy was a famed fashion designer from Britain. Cosmo (as a rich man) was criticized for bribing the crew and ignoring the women-and-children first policy, but he denied doing so. If Lucy hadn’t cancelled her Lusitanian trip in 1915, she would have been involved in another ocean tragedy – Germans torpedoed a ship that  she was supposed to be on. Regarding the Titanic disaster, it has been claimed that the Gordons lifeboat could have carried more than 12 people, but Lucy and her husband allegedly bribed the crew not to allow more passengers to join their boat, they feared for their lives.  \n",

Before her involvement in the Titanic tragedy, Jessop had early on survived the RMS Olympic collision with another ship. Lucky enough, the watertight compartment of the Olympic worked well and saved their precious lives. Amidst the commotion and shoving on the sinking Titanic,  Jessop helped non-English passengers to safety before she was officially called to join a lifeboat. In all, Jessop survived three maritime accidents – the RMS Olympic in 1911; the RMS Titanic in 1912; and the HMHS Britannic in 1916 – before dying in 1971 – she was 83. Due to her remarkable close calls with shipping disasters, Jessop often went by the name, “Miss Unsinkable”.  \n",

After surviving the disaster, he wrote a vivid account of the events leading up to the tragedy, but he didn’t live long afterward. After helping scores of other passengers to evacuate the ship, Archibald found himself resurfaced above the icy waters as the ship sank.  He climbed onto a floating lifeboat and later got rescued, along with other survivors.  \n",

Lightoller strictly observed the women-first policy to the letter, somewhat to the apparent detriment of male passengers. In all fairness he was slightly responsible for allowing half-empty lifeboats sail.  Luckily for him, he survived- this was after he had sank shortly with the ship and later resurfaced. As the minutes rolled by Lightoller;s survival instincts got sharper. He held on to his dear life by clutching onto an inverted boat until rescue came by. Years after the disaster, Lightoller would go on to make a lot of recommendations to improve maritime safety on the high seas.  \n",

She was an influential philanthropist who was among the survivors. Margaret and her husband, James Brown, became extremely wealthy after their mining business flourished at the turn of the 20th century.   As a social activist, she showed much concern for the welfare of children and women. She also helped to row back a lifeboat to the accident scene to save more survivors.  She was nicknamed “The Unsinkable Molly Brown”.  Her Titanic experience later became a Hollywood film.  \n",

As a foreigner, Hosono was initially turned away when he tried to join a lifeboat. When a second lifeboat had enough room for two more people, Hosono hopped in with his dear life. Allegedly, his survival cost him his job. The media ridiculed him and shamed his family until his last days.  \n",

Nöel was a popular personality in London. She boarded the ship together with her cousin Cherry.  The cousins were among the lucky passengers who hopped onto lifeboats and survived the tragedy. Leslie, her cousin and some crew members suggested going back to rescue more survivors, but their idea was met with resistance from other lifeboat survivors.   Nöel became very philanthropic after the disaster and discharged duties as a nurse during the First World War.
